# My Struggle
+++
I love many things. I love math, I love understanding structure, I love music, I love computer science and I think these things are all meaningful. Mathematics is the fundamental language of the universe, music is the language of emotions and computer science the language which makes the world's infrastructure run. Over the years, I've found myself drawn to things I find beautiful and it just so happens these are exactly that to me. Beautiful.

But I'm tired. 

I feel there are few who love like I do and even worse there are those who are passionate are "strange".
