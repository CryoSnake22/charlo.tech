Good morning ! I'm going to use this website as a channel for my curiosities and ideas. You may find value in my writings, or you may not. But either way let's have some fun !

This website uses Zola, a rust based site generator, I will not pretend to have come up with this succulent minimalist aesthetic myself. But I know what I like, and I like this.

As of now the site is pretty empty but I hope to fill it with good things in the future!
