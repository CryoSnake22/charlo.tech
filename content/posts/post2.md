Finding one's passion feels like a never-ending journey. There's always a shinier thing around the corner that catches your eye. And typically, even if you do find something you are deeply passionate about, there will be days when you simply do not have the motivation to get out of bed.

## Finding one's passion.

It's okay to love many things and to be interested in lots of different subjects, even if they don't seem like they'll lead to a career path. I know you feel like you need money, we all do, but basing your time budget on exterior motivations is a plan for a regret-filled death.

## Sunk Cost Fallacy

Many of us have already invested a considerable chunk of our time to the pursuit of a path, wether we chose it or others did for us. And to change said path is scary since it would mean you wasted all the time previously invested.

But the truth is that nothing is wasted. The skills you acquired in your past will serve in the future as unlikely as that may seem. If you want to pursue some other field or passion just god damn do it. Why is it so important for you to do this ? Because:

## You're gonna die soon.

It may not seem like it but your time is very limited. As people get older they say time moves quicker, the reason why it seems that way is because they've let their life go by without fighting (Post to come on this).

As you get older, your mind gets duller, your body starts hurting and many things you take for granted go away.

If you're in your 20's you have energy so USE IT. Not on booze parties and drugs, use it to learn shit. Learn about stuff you love, learn to love learning, spend your energy on things that are actually helping you because HEED MY WORD YOU WONT HAVE IT FOR LONG. Stop looking for instant gratification and start seeking things that will earn you freedom in the long term.

## Anywho

Anyways, back to the topic of passion. If you don't know what your passion, at least be passionate about finding your passion.

P.S. I have a problem staying on track
