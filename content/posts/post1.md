# Why ?
I've struggled a lot with this issue in the past and I think you have too.
You know you've got so much to do and you also know you should get started, but the thought of initiating the task makes doing the dishes seem like a vacation. I too have been stuck in procrastination hell,

But fear not for I have the solution. Here it comes: Love doing it.

...

crazy right ? who would've thought. problem solved! end of the post.

This may need more explaining

What I mean is not that you have to love doing the dishes or that you have to love doing the math study you've been avoiding all week. What I mean is that you need to find a reason why doing this thing is worth your time. And I swear that you can find meaningfulness in even the most menial things in a way which will give you the motivation to go through with them.

Let me start with an example: doing the dishes. Nobody likes doing them, the inherent act of doing the dishes is not fun. But there is a way to reframe this menial task into something that is worth your time, actually there are many ways.

Example:

- By doing the dishes I am training my discipline and therefore growing as a person.
- By doing the dishes I am cleaning my home, taking pride in my environment.
- By doing the dishes I am creating a better environment for myself and for me to accomplish my goals
- By doing the dishes I am getting rid of mental noise the will liberate my mind to focus on more important things.

I could keep going and going but I think you got the idea.

The idea here is that no matter how little the impact, no matter how little and insignificant the task, you can find something to latch on. Something which will give the task validity and importance to you. If you're doing math homework and you don't feel like this will bring you anything in life or you're wondering "when will I ever use this", you could think of things like:

- I am practicing my problem solving muscle, which will serve me greatly in life.
- I am improving my discipline and focus.

Anything can turn into a task which you personally find important if you frame it correctly.

# Once again, why is this important ?

The boring stuff is the stuff that will take you from where you are now and to where you want to be. Studying one day for 5 hours because you got a burst of motivation is not what gets you there. If you want to move your life in the direction you desire, what you need is unrelenting effort and actioning. What you need is consistency.

30 minutes a day for a month is infinitely better than 5 hours every two weeks.

The stuff you're inherently excited about should be your compass, it should guide you to where you wish to take your life.

Excitement is the equivalent to wanting to build a building, getting a loan, buying the land and buying the tools.

But without laying bricks one by one every day, you're never gonna have a building, just an empty lot with nothing but unrealized dreams. And this is where the boring stuff comes in. This is where learning to love laying those 10 bricks a day really pays off.

So if you want to stop hoping and never achieving, you need to start doing this today. Time to fall in love with boring shit.
