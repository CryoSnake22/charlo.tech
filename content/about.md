Good morning ! My name is Charles and I'm a second year Data Science undergrad at the University of Ottawa.

At first, I just wanted to study computer science, but then I took an intro to group theory class and got hooked on abstraction. And now I guess I just have to do Math too.

As clich√© as that may sound, I love learning. There's something so exciting about improving yourself and learning new things. I always like to imagine "if I was thrown onto a deserted island with no possessions, what would I be left with ?".

My current favorite hobby is Quantitative Finance. As someone who loves Mathematics, Computer Science and Finance, I was lost for a while and didn't know how to marry these interests together. Quantitative Finance marries all of those together in such a beautiful way that it almost feels like fate. I will not pretend to be an expert, but I am at the very least a very curious and passionate person.
