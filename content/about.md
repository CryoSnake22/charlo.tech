My name is Charles ! I'm a second year Data Science undergrad at the University of Ottawa.

My interests include but are not limited to mathematics, cybersecurity, AI and music. I used to study jazz piano in Cegep and Uni and loved it ! Now I'm dedicated to other things and channel that same sort of passion I had in my music studies into my curious pursuits.

I will not pretend to know what I'm doing, I am just as lost as anyone and have absolutely no clue if what I'm doing is right, optimal or (insert synonym of correctness). But I do know that pursuing what I love is worthwhile, so that's what I'm doing.

I've dedicated myself to pursue things I believe are worthwhile and meaningful, I find it quite hard to do so when the subjects of study carry no meaning or depth. The deeper the insight, the more complex the problem, the more I find myself drawn to it.

I hope I'm not sounding pretentious, this is merely a part of the ideas I struggle with every day (and I say "struggle" in the most positive way possible).

On that note, I hope you come along with me on my journey.

Let's struggle together !
